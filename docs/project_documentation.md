### 📌 Background  

In the age of digital influence, creators are increasingly turning their audiences into consumers. Lee Chatmen, a U.S.-based TikTok star with over 7 million followers, gained popularity through his viral videos featuring miniature guitar performances. Riding the wave of his online fame, Lee launched a personal merchandise brand in 2023.

This project analyzes the performance of Lee's merchandise business to uncover key drivers of sales and consumer behavior. From understanding product preferences to assessing the role of international shipping and promotional pricing, the dashboard helps stakeholders gain valuable insights into the e-commerce performance of an influencer-led brand.
